# SSG vs SSR

```jsx
const name = 'ZiaCodes'

console.log('name: ', name)
```

Static Site Generation (SSG) and Server-Side Rendering (SSR) are two popular approaches in web development for generating dynamic content. Here's a brief comparison:

## SSG

SSG pre-builds the entire website at the build time. The resulting HTML files are then served to the client, reducing server load and enabling fast page loads. However, dynamic content may require additional client-side rendering.

## SSR

SSR generates HTML on the server for each client request. This allows dynamic content to be included in the initial HTML response. SSR offers real-time updates and is suitable for interactive websites. However, server load can increase with higher traffic.

Both SSG and SSR have their pros and cons, and the choice depends on project requirements, scalability, and performance needs.
